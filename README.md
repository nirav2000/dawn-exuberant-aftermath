# Fastly: Hello world!

This is a personal website built with Vite, designed for publishing to a Fastly Deliver service that'll serve your content from the CDN. Once you have your website published, it'll benefit from Fastly's performance and security, and you'll be able to access Observability stats in the Fastly app. 🗺📊

While you're working in the editor you'll see your changes update live in the preview. Then when you leave the editor, Glitch will run vite to build your site into a bundle for optimum performance. Then Fastly will deliver this bundle super fast and securely to your users.

___Check out FASTLY.md to set up your account then the TODO to publish your site!___ ⚙️

The TL;DR

* Sign up for a <a href="https://www.fastly.com/signup/" target="_blank">free Fastly developer account</a> and grab an API token
* Pop your token into the `.env`
* Open the **Terminal** and run `npm run setup`
* Grab the service ID from the **Terminal** output and pop it into the `.env`
* Run `npm run publish`
* Grab your published URL from the **Terminal** output and open it 

_You can also point your own domain at your published project using Fastly TLS!_
